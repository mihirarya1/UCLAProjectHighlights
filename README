NAME: Mihir Arya

This is the first of a two step project whih

The tarred file lab1b-705126618.tar.gz contains four files pertaining to project 1b. The first, is this file,
a README, which gives an overview of each of the remaining files. lab1b-server.c contains the server side
implementation of this project; at a high level, it forwards client output to a child process, and then redirects
the output of the child process back towards the client. The client sends/receives data from the server, posts data
to the screen as necessary, and also mantains a log file of all communication with the server. The Makefile is capable
of building both the source files, where the default case is to build both simultaneously. It also has a clean command
which removes all files from the current working directory except the four aforementioned, and a dist command which 
produces the tar file.
