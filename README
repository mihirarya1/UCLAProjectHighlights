The tar project file for project 1a, contains this file (README), along with a source
code file (lab1a.c), and a Makefile. The source code file contains the implementation for a character-at-a-time
full duplex I/O which occurs during the general case, and the implementation to pass input in the following
manner when --shell argument is passed: Keyboard Input -> Terminal -> Shell Process -> Terminal -> Terminal Out . 
The Makefile contains a default case, which compiles the source C-file, in addition to a 'dist' case which dumps 
the three files of this project into a directory, and a 'clean' case which removes all files from the current working 
directory except for the three files part of this project.
